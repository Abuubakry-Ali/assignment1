# Case Study - REMITR  ![alt text](https://www.eshipper.com/hubfs/Remitr_guest%20blog-3.png)
## Overview and Origin
REMITR was incorporated in 2016. It is a payment system that allows people and 
businesses to send money internationally quickly, safely, and at a low cost. The company was founded by Kanchan Kumar and Sandeep Todi. Kanchan Kumar has worked on other startups before REMITR and Sandeep has a lot of experience in software development. They decided to start REMITR because of the challenges that came with making business payments using traditional banks. They decided to build a better solution that would also make global business easy. The company has received a total of 1 million dollars of funding from investors. 
## Business Activities
REMITR’s goal is to improve the payment experience for remittances and businesses working internationally. They are trying to solve the problem of late and inconsistent payments to workers due to long manual banking processes. The company also solves the problem of cost associated with traditional wire transfers, cheques, and other businesses that take cuts from payments and charge fees for currency conversion. REMITR allows automatic mass payouts which save businesses a lot of time.
REMITR’s intended customers are businesses with employers based remotely in other regions and countries. Their business is also for people sending remittances to their families. They hope to get a part of the $600 billion consumer remittance market.
REMITR offers many solutions that their competitors do not. Firstly, they use real time foreign exchange rates. They also do not charge large fees on international payments like banks and most other remittance services. Another thing is that REMITR is faster than most competitors and delivers within one to two days.
REMITR has developed MoneyOS which is an operating system for international payments. The system is designed based on blockchain technology. It uses machine learning to allow users to collect and make international payments from a single account while meeting the local regulatory guidelines in each country. The system uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to move money safely across different payment networks such as bank accounts and crypto wallets.
## Landscape
REMITR is in the payment and billing FinTech domain. Some of the major companies in the remittance/ payment and billing domain are World Remit, currencyfair, Frontierpay, TransferWise and Global Reach.  
One of the main trends in this domain has been customers moving away from cash payments. Another trend has been instant payments and more people using alternative payment methods. More stores are also following the trend of getting customers to subscribe to services.
There have been many innovations in the payment and billing domain in the last few years. Biometric security and authentication using fingerprints, voice recognition, and facial recognition is one example. In 2019, a UK bank used the very first biometric fingerprint credit card. In the future, this technology is expected to make customer authentication easier and faster.
With the customer subscription trend on the rise, more customers are sharing their credit card and payment details online. A new innovation called tokenization has been introduced to secure customer data. Tokenization replaces payment details with a unique ID or token. This creates additional security and even protects customers from hackers who can not reuse the payment details if they are not linked to a token.
## Results
There are several core metrics companies in this domain use to measure success. The first is the successful to unsuccessful transactions ratio which is equal to the percentage of successful transactions. Another is the overall conversion rate. This is equivalent to the total number of users divided by the total number of users paying for the digital goods. The average revenue per user and average transaction value are other metrics of success that can be used. In addition, the churn rate is another measure. It is the number of users who continue to use the service, how long they use the service for, and their overall user value. 
REMITR  has helped reduce the cost of remittance and further the global goal of cost reduction in remittances. The company is also amongst the top 20 Fintech startups in the Middle East and has established itself in the UAE and Canada which are two of the major sources for remittances. In 2019, REMITR users moved a total of $150 million dollars across the world. A total of 35 000 payments were done using their service. This showed a lot of growth compared to the previous years.
## Recommendations
If I were to advise the company, there are a few products or services I would suggest. To begin with, I would suggest they make their website multilingual. This would make it easier for international users and increase the number of users. Another suggestion is to create cash pick up locations so that recipients do not need to go through a bank to receive their money. This would help to reduce bank fees and increase access to many international employees or family members. 
I would also suggest they add the option to top up mobile wallets from different countries because this is a method used by many countries and offered by leading competitors like World Remit. Users would also be able to make purchases and payments with their mobile wallet. The mobile wallet would be an app protected with biometric authentication. The application would transfer information using Near-Field Communications (NFC). NFC technology has been used successfully by many other companies to implement mobile wallets. These technologies mean the mobile wallet would be secure and able to communicate effectively with payment devices.
